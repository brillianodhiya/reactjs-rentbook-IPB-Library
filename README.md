## The idea behind this project

This project is made by ReactJS for frontend and Redux for management global state. This frontend made inspirated by [this figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Mj3THivoX0IaTPEZ4vJZoajw/Books?node-id=0%3A1), to bootstrap i've use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). But for stylig animation i just use [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#targetText=Hypertext%20Markup%20Language%20(HTML)%20is,scripting%20languages%20such%20as%20JavaScript.) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
